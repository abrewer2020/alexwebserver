                <div class="content">
                    <p>As a part of 4-H in high school, I took on several robotics projects utilizing Lego's EV3 set. One of my favorite projects was a miniature printer that I designed, built, and programmed. It used three dimensions of movement to move a pen on a piece of paper. To program it, I taught myself the fundamentals of programming and of Python. This was my first real experience with programming and helped to inspire me to pursue a career in software engineering. This project beat everyone else in my county allowing me to present it at the state fair.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>In my Introduction to Engineering course freshman year, I created a virtual Connect 4 game with a small group of my peers. My chief contribution is a fully functional AI opponent that operated on the minimax algorithm. It is able to look several moves in advance and calculate the best possible move for it to take. I was very pleased with how it turned out. It can beat me most of the time.</p>
                    <p>Tools: Matlab, Minimax Algorithm</p>
                    <p>[I don't have any pictures of it because I no longer have a license for Matlab to run it, but it looks like Connect 4]</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>As a part of my Principles of Programming course, I wrote an interpreter for the <a href="https://core-lang.dev/" target="_blank">Core</a> programming language. Core is a very simple and easy-to-use language derrived from Dora. This interpreter was entirely written in Java.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>As part of my education at Ohio State, I was required to take a junior project class similar to a capstone course. Over the course of a semester, I worked closely with a small team of my peers to design, develop, and test a video game using Agile methodologies. We decided to implement a clone of the original Legend of Zelda from the ground up using C#. We used a minimalist game engine called Monogame and created everything from scratch. In particular, I worked on all the block objects that made up the level, save files, level generation, and the maps that populated based on which rooms you have visited. For fun we also added a secret level of the game Overcooked using Link as the cook.</p>
                    <p>Tools: C#, Monogame, Agile methodologies</p>

                    <p>As a part of my senior mobile app development course, I built a simple android application with two of my classmates that helps you to locate events from your friends and different organizations around town. We used MVVM architecture and concurrent programming to create a quick and responsive interface for our users. We also utilized Google's Firebase for authentication and database services as well as Mapbox for its mapping tools.</p>
